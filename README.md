# Ecommerce Website

This project was part of a course on LinkedIn called "React for Web Designers"

There are three files in this repo:

- App.js and index.html create the ecommerce website using React.
- mockup.html is the same website made using raw HTML.

The goal of the course was to edit index.html and App.js such that
the website created by index.html will be exactly alike to mockup.html (only index.html uses React components)
